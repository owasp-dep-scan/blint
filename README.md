`blint` is a Binary Linter that checks the security properties and capabilities of your executables. It is powered by [lief](https://github.com/lief-project/LIEF) and can generate a Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOM) for supported binaries.

## What is blint?

blint is a tool for reverse engineers, security analysts, and developers to quickly assess the security posture and composition of a binary file. In an age of statically-linked Golang, Rust, and .NET applications, understanding what's inside a binary is more important than ever. blint automates this initial triage process.

**Supported Binary Formats:**

- ELF (for GNU and musl libc)
- PE (Windows executables and DLLs)
- Mach-O (macOS and iOS, x64 and arm64)
- Android (APK, AAB, including DEX files in deep mode)

## Key Features & Use Cases

- **Comprehensive Security Audits:** Automatically checks for common security mitigations like PIE, ASLR, NX, Stack Canaries, and RELRO. Ideal for ensuring your CI/CD pipeline produces hardened binaries.
- **Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOM) Generation:** Creates CycloneDX SBOMs for binaries built with Go, Rust, .NET, and Android toolchains, providing a clear inventory of third-party components for vulnerability management.
- **Deep Binary Inspection:** Extracts and analyzes a wealth of information including symbols, functions, dependencies, and build toolchains. This raw data is saved as a detailed JSON file.
  - **For a complete guide to all attributes in this file, see the [Technical Metadata Documentation](./docs/METADATA.md).**
- **Capability Analysis:** Identifies potentially sensitive capabilities by reviewing imported functions and symbols, such as network access, filesystem operations, or cryptographic API usage.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Can be added to build pipelines to enforce security policies, such as requiring code signing on all release artifacts.
- **Fuzzing Target Identification:** Suggests interesting functions to target for fuzzing based on common patterns in function names (e.g., `parse`, `decode`, `copy`).
- **Extensible with Custom Rules:** Define your own capabilities and checks using simple [YAML rule files](./docs/RULES.md).

## Installation

`blint` requires Python >= 3.10.

```bash
pip install blint
```

For **disassembly support**, which enables instruction-level analysis of functions, install the `extended` version. This includes the [nyxstone](https://github.com/emproof-com/nyxstone) disassembler.

```bash
pip install blint[extended]
```

### Standalone Executables

Single-file executables that do not require Python are available from the [blint releases page](https://github.com/OWASP-dep-scan/blint/releases). The macOS `.pkg` file is signed with a valid Apple Developer ID.

## Quick Start

Analyze a binary and save the reports to the `/tmp/blint` directory:

```bash
blint -i /bin/netstat -o /tmp/blint
```

Analyze a Go or Rust binary and get suggestions for fuzzing targets:

```bash
blint -i /path/to/my-binary --suggest-fuzzable
```

Generate a CycloneDX SBOM for an Android application:

```shell
blint sbom -i /path/to/app.apk -o bom.cdx.json
```

## Understanding the Output

blint produces several JSON artifacts in the specified reports directory.

| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `exename-metadata.json` | **Raw, detailed metadata** extracted from the binary. This is the source for all other reports. | Contains everything: headers, symbols, functions, dependencies, signature info, and more. See the **[Technical Metadata Documentation](./docs/METADATA.md)** for a full breakdown. |
| `findings.json`         | A summary of the **security properties audit**. Designed for CI/CD integration.                 | Lists security mitigations like PIE, NX, and Stack Canaries and whether they are present.                                                                                          |
| `reviews.json`          | A summary of the **capability review**.                                                         | Lists detected capabilities (e.g., "networking", "file-read", "crypto") based on the symbols and functions found.                                                                  |
| `fuzzables.json`        | A list of **suggested functions to fuzz**, generated when using the `--suggest-fuzzable` flag.  | Identifies functions with names that suggest data parsing or manipulation, which are often good candidates for fuzzing.                                                            |
| `bom-*.cdx.json`        | The **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)**, generated by the `sbom` sub-command.                 | A CycloneDX-formatted JSON file detailing the binary's components and dependencies.                                                                                                |

## Advanced Usage: SBOM Generation with blintdb

For C/C++ binaries, identifying components from symbols alone can be imprecise. `blint` can use **blintdb**, a pre-compiled database of symbols from popular open-source libraries (like those from vcpkg), to dramatically improve component identification.

The workflow is a two-step process:

1.  **Download the blintdb database:**

    ```shell
    blint db --download
    ```

    This downloads the database to the directory specified by the `BLINTDB_HOME` environment variable.

2.  **Generate the SBOM with blintdb enabled:**
    ```shell
    blint sbom -i /path/to/binary -o bom.cdx.json --use-blintdb
    ```

This will cross-reference symbols found in your binary against the database to identify components like OpenSSL, zlib, and others.
